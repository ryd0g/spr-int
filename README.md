Price Matcher
-------------

Price Matcher is a concept Ryan and I devised that's meant to minimize the amount of effort a user will need to make when searching for a store with the cheapest price
for the product they want.


How It Works
------------

At the top, a search bar allows a user to search for any product of their choosing.
Then, in the middle of the page, 3 panels display a redirect link for the search results across all 3 stores in the demonstration.

Future Developments
-------------------

-Feature to display all search results on the main site itself via API calls.
